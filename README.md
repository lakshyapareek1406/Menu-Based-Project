Here's a revised version of the guide without the code, focusing on the steps:

AWS Cloud Implementation Guide
This guide provides step-by-step instructions for various tasks involving AWS services, including EC2, S3, Lambda, SES, and more.

1. Launch EC2 Instances
   
(i)  Log in to AWS Management Console: 
        -> Access the AWS Console and log in with your credentials.
        
(ii) Navigate to EC2: 
       -> In the AWS Console, find and select EC2 under the "Compute" section.
       
(iii) Launch an Instance:
       -> Click "Launch Instance."
       -> Choose an Amazon Machine Image (AMI) and instance type.
       -> Configure instance details, storage, and security groups.
       -> Review and launch the instance.
       
(iv) Connect to the Instance: 
       -> Once the instance is running, select it and follow the instructions to connect using SSH or EC2 Instance Connect.
       

2. Launch RHEL GUI Instance in Cloud

   
(i) Select RHEL AMI: 
       -> During the EC2 launch process, choose the RHEL AMI.
       
(ii) Configure Instance: 
       -> Choose an instance type, configure details, and allow SSH and VNC ports in the security group.
       
(iii) Install GUI: 
       -> After launching the instance, connect via SSH and install the GUI.
       
(iv) Access the GUI: 
      -> Use a VNC client to connect to the RHEL GUI using the instance's public IP.
      

3. Access Logs from the Cloud
   

(i) Use CloudWatch: 
     -> Go to CloudWatch in the AWS Console.
     
(ii) View Logs: 
     -> Click on "Logs" and select the relevant log group and stream.
     
(iii) Optional-Configure Log Streaming: 
     -> Set up log streaming from your EC2 instances or other AWS services to CloudWatch.
     

4. Create Event-Driven Architecture with S3 and Transcribe
   
   
(i) Set Up S3 Bucket: 
     -> Create a new S3 bucket in the AWS Console.
     
(ii) Create Lambda Function: 
     -> Develop a Lambda function that triggers AWS Transcribe when an audio file is uploaded to the S3 bucket.
     
(iii) Set Up S3 Trigger: 
     -> Add a Lambda trigger to your S3 bucket.
     
(iv) Test the Setup: 
     -> Upload an audio file to the S3 bucket and verify that the transcription is generated.
     

5. Connect Python to MongoDB Using Lambda

   
(i) Set Up MongoDB Cluster: 
     -> Create a MongoDB Atlas cluster or use an existing one and obtain the connection string.
     
(ii) Create Lambda Function: 
     -> Develop a Lambda function to connect to MongoDB using the connection string.
     
(iii) Set Environment Variables: 
     -> Add the MongoDB connection string as an environment variable in Lambda.
     
(iv) Test the Function: 
     -> Invoke the Lambda function and verify its interaction with MongoDB.
     

6. Upload Objects to S3
   

(i) Create S3 Bucket: 
     -> Create or use an existing S3 bucket.
     
(ii) Upload Objects: 
     -> Use AWS CLI or a Python script with Boto3 to upload objects to the S3 bucket.
     

7. Integrate Lambda with S3 and Send Emails via SES
   

(i) Set Up S3 Bucket: 
    -> Create an S3 bucket and upload a file containing email IDs.
    
(ii) Create Lambda Function:
    -> Develop a Lambda function that retrieves the email IDs from the S3 file and sends emails using SES.
    
(iii) Set Up S3 Trigger:
    -> Add a trigger to the S3 bucket to invoke the Lambda function.
    
(iv) Test the Function:
    -> Upload a file with email IDs and verify that the emails are sent.




I will add additional things in the coming time as I have converted it into a website, connect with me and cover it. Thank you for viewing my project.
